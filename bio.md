I am a third year PhD student at the [UCL FAI CDT](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/foundational-ai-cdt/foundational-artificial-intelligence-mphilphd) and [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/), supervised by [Matt Kusner](https://mkusner.github.io/) and [Michael Bronstein](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/michael.bronstein/). I also do Bayesian Optimisation research at [Matterhorn Studio](https://matterhorn.studio/).

Previously I was a MSc student at the [African Masters of Machine Intelligence](https://aimsammi.org/), and a research intern at the Vector Institute with [Rahul G. Krishnan](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rahulgk/index.html) working on uncertainty measurement for generalization. I obtained my BSc in Computer Science from [Ashesi University](https://www.ashesi.edu.gh/) in 2020.

I am broadly interested in modeling techniques that use the (sometimes implicit) structures present in data generating processes, datasets, and models' internal representations. More specifically, at the moment, I am interested in [understanding and improving message passing models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04301.pdf), [domain generalisation and adaptation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.05470.pdf), and [multi-fidelity Bayesian optimisation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.12633.pdf)
