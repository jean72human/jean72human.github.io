Gbetondji Dovonon is a MSc student at the [African Masters of Machine Intelligence](https://aimsammi.org/), an intensive masters sponsored by Google and Facebook. I obtained my BSc in Computer Science from [Ashesi University](https://www.ashesi.edu.gh/) in 2020.
My interests are in:
- deep learning with structured data
- meta learning, meta reinforcement learning and neural architecture search
- neural algorithmic reasoning 

Currrently I am working at the intersection of graph neural networks (GNNs) and computational graphs. More specifically, I am interested in how we can use GNNs to improve the performance of neural network architectures, either using performance prediction or graph hypernetworks.
