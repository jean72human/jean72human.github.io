I am a first year PhD student at the [UCL FAI CDT](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/foundational-ai-cdt/foundational-artificial-intelligence-mphilphd) and [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/), supervised by [Matt Kusner](https://mkusner.github.io/) and [Michael Bronstein](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/michael.bronstein/).
Previously I was a MSc student at the [African Masters of Machine Intelligence](https://aimsammi.org/), and a research intern at the Vector Institute with [Rahul G. Krishnan](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rahulgk/index.html) working on uncertainty measurement for generalization. I obtained my BSc in Computer Science from [Ashesi University](https://www.ashesi.edu.gh/) in 2020.

My interests is in modeling techniques that use the implicit structures present in data to improve generalization and data efficiency.
