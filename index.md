I am a MSc student at the [African Masters of Machine Intelligence](https://aimsammi.org/), an intensive masters sponsored by Google and Facebook. I obtained my BSc in Computer Science from [Ashesi University](https://www.ashesi.edu.gh/) in 2020.
My interests are in:
- geometric deep learning
- deep learning with structured data
- meta learning, meta reinforcement learning and neural architecture search
- reasoning and machine learning

## Current work

Currently I am working at the intersection of graph neural networks (GNNs) and computational graphs. More specifically, I am interested in how we can use GNNs to improve the performance of neural network architectures, either using performance prediction or graph hypernetworks.

## News

- [January 10, 2022] I am starting a research internship at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) under the supervision of [Rahul G. Krishnan](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rahulgk/index.html)
